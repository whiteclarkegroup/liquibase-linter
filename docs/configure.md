title: Configure
---

Liquibase Linter doesn't have a standard configuration, so it's up to you to decide what you want it to enforce and how on your project.

## JSON config file

You do this by providing a `lqlint.json` file at the root of your project. Here's how it's structured:

```json
{
    "ignore-context-pattern": null,
    "rules": {}
}
```

This example has nothing switched on but is a good place to start; you can [grab it from here](../examples/lqlint.json).

## Ignoring certain changes

### `ignore-context-pattern`

This config entry is an optional regular expression for contexts that, if found on a changeSet, will cause the linter to skip checking that changeSet. This can be useful when you have scripts in your project that were [generated by a tool](https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/generating_changelogs.html) and wouldn't pass your normal quality checks for hand-rolled scripts.

Example usage:

```json
{
    "ignore-context-pattern": "^baseline.*$",
    "rules": {}
}
```

<small>(Regular expression literals aren't valid JSON, so you do need to use a string.)</small>

### "lql-ignore" comments

Sometimes you might have to do something less than perfect to get you out of a jam, and it might break some of your usual quality rules. In these cases, you can include the text "lql-ignore" at the end of the changeSet's `<comment>` tag and it will be skipped by the linter:

```xml
<changeSet id="201809061514dg" author="dgoss">
    <comment>Doing awful things to fix a problem lql-ignore</comment>
    
    <!-- awful things here -->
</changeSet>
```

You can also disable an individual rule while leaving all others on, if that's all you need:

```xml
<changeSet id="201809061514dg" author="dgoss">
    <comment>Empty this whole table lql-ignore:modify-data-enforce-where</comment>
    
    <delete tableName="FOO"/>
</changeSet>
```
