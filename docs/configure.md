title: Configure
---

Liquibase Linter doesn't have a default configuration, so it's up to you to decide what you want it to enforce and how on your project.

You do this by providing a `lqlint.json` file at the root of your project. Here's how it's structured:

```json
{
    "ignore-context-pattern": null,
    "illegal-change-types": [],
    "rules": {}
}
```

This example has nothing switched on but is a good starting point; you can [grab it from here](../examples/lqlint.json).

## `ignore-context-pattern`

This is an optional regular expression for contexts that, if found on a `changeSet`, will cause the linter to skip checking that `changeSet`. This can be useful when you have scripts in your project that were [generated by a tool](https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/generating_changelogs.html) and wouldn't pass your normal quality checks for hand-rolled scripts.

Example usage:

```json
{
    "ignore-context-pattern": "^baseline.*$"
}
```

<small>(Regular expression literals aren't valid JSON, so you do need to use a string.)</small>

## `illegal-change-types`

This is an optional array of class names for [change types](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/tree/master/liquibase-core/src/main/java/liquibase/change/core) you want to entirely disallow from being used. This can be useful when you want to put hard limits on the type of changes that can be done in your project, to prevent problems.

Example usage:

```json
{
    "illegal-change-types": [
        "liquibase.change.core.LoadDataChange"
    ]
}
```

<small>(While you have to use the fully classname of the change type at the moment, we'll [soon add support](https://github.com/whiteclarkegroup/liquibase-linter/issues/13) for just using the tag name.)
