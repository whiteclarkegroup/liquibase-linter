title: Configure
---

Liquibase Linter doesn't have a standard configuration, so it's up to you to decide what you want it to enforce and how on your project.

## JSON config file

You do this by providing a `lqlint.json` file at the root of your project. Here's how it's structured:

```json
{
    "fail-fast": false,
    "ignore-context-pattern": null,
    "ignore-files-pattern": null,
    "enable-from": null,
    "rules": {}
}
```

This example has nothing switched on but is a good place to start; you can [grab it from here](../examples/lqlint.json).

## Reporting and `fail-fast`

By default, lint failures are aggregated and reported at the end after all changes are scanned:

![Example console output for failed rules](/liquibase-linter/img/console-example.png)

If you prefer, you can set `fail-fast` to `true` in your config file so that the process will exit as soon as it finds the first failure.

## Ignoring certain changes

### `enable-from`

This config option allows enabling liquibase linter from a certain point in time. This is configured by choosing a change log file path to enable from.
Once this change log has been reached, liquibase linter will run for all changes after. This option is exclusive so the file you pass as the config
value **will not** be linted.

This is useful for integrating Liquibase Linter into existing projects which have many legacy changes that fall foul of the configured lint rules.

Example use:

`example-1.xml` configured as the enable from point, both `example-2.xml` and `example-3.xml`
**will** be linted. `example-1.xml` will **not** be linted.

```json
{
    "enable-from": "src/main/resources/example-1.xml",
    "rules": {}
}
```
*Root deltas change log*
```xml
<databaseChangeLog
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.3.xsd">

    <include relativeToChangelogFile="true" file="example-1.xml"/>
    <include relativeToChangelogFile="true" file="example-2.xml"/>
    <include relativeToChangelogFile="true" file="example-3.xml"/>

</databaseChangeLog>
```


### `ignore-context-pattern`

This config entry is an optional regular expression for contexts that, if found on a changeSet, will cause the linter to skip checking that changeSet. This can be useful when you have scripts in your project that were [generated by a tool](https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/generating_changelogs.html) and wouldn't pass your normal quality checks for hand-rolled scripts.

Example usage:

```json
{
    "ignore-context-pattern": "^baseline.*$",
    "rules": {}
}
```

<small>(Regular expression literals aren't valid JSON, so you do need to use a string.)</small>

### `ignore-files-pattern`

This config entry is an optional regular expression for file patterns that, if matched on a changeSet, will cause the linter to skip checking that changeSet.

Example usage:

```json
{
    "ignore-files-pattern": "^src/main/resources/core/legacy/.*$",
    "rules": {}
}
```
<small>To avoid issues with script file paths resolving to using either `\` or `/`, all occurrences of `\` are replaced with `/`

<small>(Regular expression literals aren't valid JSON, so you do need to use a string.)</small>

### "lql-ignore" comments

Sometimes you might have to do something less than perfect to get you out of a jam, and it might break some of your usual quality rules. In these cases, you can include the text "lql-ignore" at the end of the changeSet's `<comment>` tag and it will be skipped by the linter:

```xml
<changeSet id="201809061514dg" author="dgoss">
    <comment>Doing awful things to fix a problem lql-ignore</comment>
    
    <!-- awful things here -->
</changeSet>
```

You can also disable an individual rule while leaving all others on, if that's all you need:

```xml
<changeSet id="201809061514dg" author="dgoss">
    <comment>Empty this whole table lql-ignore:modify-data-enforce-where</comment>
    
    <delete tableName="FOO"/>
</changeSet>
```
