## Why?

Comments in changeSets provide a useful record of what the intent of the change was, in natural language. They can also make code reviews easier, by being in with the code rather than in a commit message.

The `has-comment` rule will fail if any changeSets don't have a `<comment>`.

## Options

No extra options.
